        <li>These are the real feelings of mine where i can't ignore them even if i want!!</li>
        <li>I love everything about u</li>
        <li>If it is u i can do anything</li>
        <li>I always try to postpone things in my matters but when it comes to u i want to be first to do it</li>
        <li>I always think how to make u happy</li>
        <li>But then i remember the quote "To make the Bond STRONG bad days are also required"</li>
        <li>no matter how much i want u to be happy there will be days that u will be sad because of me but remember that those days u will get upset or get angry but for me it is like death because i never want to u be sad because of me for any reason it might be!</li>
        <li>I still remember the day u did fasting for me from that i wanted to do something for u</li>
        <li>Now for past 3 months i am doing SATURDAYS for u - NO Non-veg, Headbath, etc</li>
        <li>on every Saturday i will pray to god that "i want her to be happy even if she is not with me", "Give all her sadness to me" </li>
        <li>UR KISS is drug that takes me to heaven and makes me happiest person in the World </li>
        <li>I have never put this much Effort for anyone to be with me but for u i am willing to everything!</li>
        <li>THANK YOU MAA for coming in to my life and making it beautiful</li>
        <li>I will be happy to the last if u r in my life even as a friend (recommended) or sister (not recommended)</li>
        <li>In my Life U R MOST PRECIOUS TO ME</li>
        <li>I don't know whether u will remember me r not but i can never forget u i have never LOVED anyone this way and as beautiful as u </li>
        <li>No one has ever called me NANNA i love when u call me that u have forgotten these days </li>
        <li>I only call u MAA apart from my mother. U and My Mother have the power to make smile even if im sad! </li>
